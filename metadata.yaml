  ACCESS-ESM1.5 global coupled model configuration running in co2 concentration driven mode under time varying historical (1850-2014) forcings, as described in Ziehn et al. (2020), https://doi.org/10.1071/ES19035.
  Historical forcing data including atmospheric co2 concentrations are primarily sourced from UKMO versions of CMIP6 inputs, with land use change data adapted from the Land-Use Harmonisation 2 (LUH2) dataset developed for CMIP6 (Hurtt et al. 2017), https://doi.org/10.22033/ESGF/input4MIPs.1127.
notes: |-
  The developers of ACCESS-ESM1.5 request that users of these model configurations:
   (a) Cite https://doi.org/10.1071/ES19035
   (b) Include an acknowledgment such as the following:
   "The authors thank CSIRO for developing the ACCESS-ESM1.5 model configuration and making it freely available to researchers."
   ACCESS-NRI requests users follow the guidelines for acknowledging ACCESS-NRI and include a statement such as:
   "This research used the ACCESS-ESM1.5 model infrastructure provided by ACCESS-NRI, which is enabled by the Australian Government's National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS)."
